			<h2>Brigade's Organize through the Four Ps</h2>
		</div>
			<strong>People.</strong> Every Brigade needs leadership, core team members, regular hack nights, and online chanelles where citizens can engage.</li><br><br>
			<strong>Plans.</strong> As Brigades build, they set startegic plans organized around the <a href="http://jekit.codeforamerica.org/codeforamerica/codeforamerica.org/digital-principles/governments/capabilities/">Code for America Principles of Digital Government</a>. </li><br><br>
			<strong>Partnerships.</strong> One key way Brigades accomplish their goals is by partnering with local government officials and other community organizations in their cities.</li><br><br>
			<strong>Participation.</strong> Brigades utilize the various Code for America network platforms to share stories, build and re-deploy projects, and further organize around transparency in government.</li><br><br>
